Silver (Ag), gold (Au), or copper (Cu) are used for the metallic coating on a prism base or fiber core. but, Au exhibits a higher resonance parameter shift concerning the variations in the refractive index. Instead, Ag provides a narrower SPR curve width (FWHM). that causes a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Due to the oxidation, the chemical strength of Ag is weak making it intolerable to obtain a reproducible result.

In the wavelength range of 600 nm–750 nm, copper is an alternative plasmonic material with virtually identical interband transition and optical damping as Au [46]. Unfortunately, copper is vulnerable to oxidation as well.

Optical fiber SPR sensors based on copper–graphene [47] and Ag–graphene [50, 51] have longterm strength and reliable performance.
