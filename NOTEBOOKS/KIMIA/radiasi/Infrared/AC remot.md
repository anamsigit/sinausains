AC remote, TV remote mereka menggunakan elektromagnetik infrared yang dikodekan seperti kode morse. 

main technology used in home remote controls is infrared (IR) light. A transmitter is often a light emitting diode (LED). The infrared light pulses form a pattern unique to that button (A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical). 

Since infrared (IR) remote controls use light, they require line of sight. the Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver

> The emitter is an IR LED and the detector is an IR photodiode
