Several rating systems have been developed for determining a laboratoryâ€™s performance and the
meaning of the results of the different scoring systems are not always comparable. Among various
statistics, z-scores and u-scores are most often used. The drawback of z-scores is that the uncertainty
of the measurement result is not taken into account for the evaluation of performance. In the case of
u-scores, the evaluation includes uncertainties of the measurements and the uncertainty of the
assigned value (IAEA, No.3,2009)

The general validation
parameters are specificity, detection limit,
ruggedness (reproducibility), bias (accuracy),
precision (repeatability), and robustness (EURACHEM / CITAC GUIDE CG4. Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement. 2nd Edition. 2000.)
