Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, Zigbee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. The transmitter part is divided into two parts, the RF remote control and the transmitter module. The receiver is generally one of two types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne

Devices connected in a Bluetooth network communicate with each other using ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio waves. These are electromagnetic waves with frequencies around 2.4 gigahertz (2.4 billion waves per second). BluetoothÂ® technology uses the 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum band (2400 to 2483.5 MHz). NFC can receive, send, or search waves. superheterodyne receiver, often shortened to superhet, is a type of radio receiver
