a simple multiple-access acoustic protocol designed and tested by the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). JANUS is in process to become a NATO standard but is not intended to be solely military nor only for NATO, but also for civil and international adoption

> JANUS is unique in its open and public nature such that academia, industry and governments may all benefit from its use

The specification of the signal encoding and message format is fully described so that anyone may construct a transmitter/receiver to communicate via JANUS to any other compliant platform
